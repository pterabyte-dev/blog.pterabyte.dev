Hello everyone :wave:, my name is Daniel. By day I work as a network architect developing and supporting
solutions for customers, and by night I bide my time and curiosity by experimenting in my homelab.

The purpose of this blog is to document said testing and development, while sharing useful knowledge and
configurations with all of you.

In my homelab I have been typically focusing on Docker running in TrueNAS Scale. I also have been messing
around with some VPS instances running Almalinux.

If anyone has any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out via any of the included social links.
In the mean time, have fun exploring this blog.
