Welcome to the source code for **[blog.pterabyte.dev](https://blog.pterabyte.dev)**.

This site is a technical blog documenting my journey as a **Network Architect** and **Homelab Enthusiast**. It serves as a repository for knowledge, configurations, and "lessons learned" regarding enterprise networking, TrueNAS Scale, and Docker.

## 🚀 About The Project

The purpose of this blog is to bridge the gap between networking concepts and homelab environments. It documents testing and development, specifically focusing on how to make complex networking behaviors (like MACVLAN/IPVLAN) work reliably within containerized environments.

### Key Topics
* **TrueNAS Scale:** Advanced configuration, storage management, and networking.
* **Docker:** Custom networking, `docker-compose` strategies, and container isolation.
* **Automation:** Scripts and tools to maintain the lab.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features

This site is built as a Static Site using **Jekyll** and hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

### Theme
This repository uses the **[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)** theme by Cotes2020. It was chosen for its clean, text-focused design, responsiveness, and built-in dark mode support.
