This is a personal technical blog, but I welcome contributions from the community, specifically regarding:

* **Corrections:** Fixing typos, broken links, or grammatical errors in posts.
* **Technical Updates:** If a script or configuration I posted has become deprecated or needs an update for a newer version of TrueNAS/Docker.
* **Bug Fixes:** Issues with the site layout or Jekyll configuration.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone the project** to your own machine.
3. **Commit changes** to your own branch.
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** so I can review your changes.

**Note:** Since this is a personal blog, I may decline Pull Requests that significantly alter the tone, opinion, or content of the articles.
