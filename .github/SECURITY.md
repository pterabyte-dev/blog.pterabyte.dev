# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this is a static site/blog, the "supported version" is always the current deployment on the `main` or `master` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously, especially regarding the configuration advice and scripts provided on this blog.

If you discover a security vulnerability in the code, scripts, or configuration examples provided here, **please do not open a public issue.**

Instead, please report it via email:
**info@pterabyte.dev**

I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
